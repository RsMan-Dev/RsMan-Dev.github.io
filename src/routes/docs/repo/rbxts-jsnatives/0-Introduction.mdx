This library aims to add all missing javascript natives to roblox.

## Why this library ?

You may ask you why this library exists in a workd where object-utils or luau-polyfills exists.

Well, the answer is simple, none of these libraries includes a proxy support for roblox,
features that needs to rewrite all the natives to work correctly.  
As on my own libraries a ise proxies a lot, i needed to make my own library to implement javascript natives supporting proxies.

## Installation

To use this library, you need to install it using roblox-ts.

```bash title="roblox-ts"
npm install @rbxts/jsnatives
```

You also can install it directly from github (in case you want to use a unreleased version):

```bash
npm install @rbxts/jsnatives@github:RsMan-Dev/rbxts-jsnatives
```

## How to use

You simply just have to import the objects utilities you want to use

```ts
import { Proxy, Object } from "@rbxts/jsnatives";

const proxy = new Proxy({}, {get: (target, prop) => {
  if(Object.hasOwn(target, prop)) return target[prop];
  return "none";
}});

proxy.a = 1;
print(proxy.a, proxy.b); // 1 none
```

- Object methods:
  - isArray => check if the object is an array
  - create => create an object
  - keys => get all keys
  - entries => get all entries
  - values => get all values
  - assign => assign an object
  - fromEntries => create an object from an array of entries
  - hasOwn => check if the object has a key
  - isEmpty => check if the object is empty
  - dup => duplicate an object

  - equals => check if the object is equal to another object
