# Object.diff

Computes the difference between two objects, returning the changes needed to transform the second object into the first object.

## Signature

```ts
function diff<T, U, Deep extends boolean>(current: T, other: U, deep?: Deep): Diff<T, U, Deep>
```

## Description

The `Object.diff()` method computes the difference between two objects, returning an object that represents the changes needed to transform the second object (`other`) into the first object (`current`). This is particularly useful for tracking changes in state management and synchronization.

The `diffDeletedSymbol` is a special symbol used internally to mark deleted properties in the diff result., when other has a key, that is not in current, it will be marked as deleted using this symbol.

## Examples

### Basic diff computation

```ts
const current = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const other = { a: 1, b: 4, d: 5 };

const result = Object.diff(current, other);
print(result); // { b: 2, c: 3, d: {} (diffDeletedSymbol) }
```

### Deep diff computation

if deep is true, 2 tables will be compared recursively instead of using a shallow comparison.

```ts
const current = { 
  user: { 
    name: "John", 
    age: 30 
  }
};
const other = { 
  user: { 
    name: "John", 
    age: 31 
  }
};

const result = Object.diff(current, other, true);
print(result); // { user: { age: 30 } }
```

## Notes

- The `diffDeletedSymbol` is an internal implementation detail and should not be used directly in application code, or only when making custom diff implementations tu use in Object.patch.
- When using deep diff, nested objects are compared recursively, but no cache or limit is implemented, so self-referencing tables will cause a stack overflow if you want to support that, you will need to implement your own recursive algorithm implementing Object.diff(a, b, false).
- The diff result can be used with `Object.patch()` to transform the second object into the first object
- The diff operation is designed so that `patch(other, diff(current, other))` will transform `other` to match `current`, so after patching, Object.equals(patch(other, diff(current, other)), current) will normally be true.
