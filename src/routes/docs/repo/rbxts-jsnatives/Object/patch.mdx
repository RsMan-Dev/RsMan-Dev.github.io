# Object.patch

Applies a diff object to transform the target object according to the changes specified in the diff.

## Signature

```ts
function patch<T, U, Deep extends boolean>(current: T, diff: U, deep?: Deep): T
```

## Description

The `Object.patch()` method applies a diff object (typically created by `Object.diff()`) to transform the target object according to the changes specified in the diff. This is useful for applying incremental updates to objects, particularly in state management and synchronization scenarios.

The patch operation is designed to work with the diff operation in a way that `patch(other, diff(current, other))` will transform `other` to match `current`.

## Examples

### Basic patching

```ts
const current = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const other = { a: 1, b: 4, d: 5 };

const diff = Object.diff(current, other);
const result = Object.patch(other, diff);
print(result); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
```

### Deep patching

```ts
const current = { 
  user: { 
    name: "John", 
    age: 30 
  }
};
const other = { 
  user: { 
    name: "John", 
    age: 31 
  }
};

const diff = Object.diff(current, other, true);
const result = Object.patch(other, diff, true);
print(result); // { user: { name: "John", age: 30 } }
```

## Notes

- The patch operation is designed to work with the diff operation to transform objects, but you can implement your own patch operation to work with your own diff operation.
- When using deep patch, nested objects are updated recursively, but no cache or limit is implemented, so self-referencing tables will cause a stack overflow if you want to support that, you will need to implement your own recursive algorithm implementing Object.patch(a, b, false).
- Properties where the value in patch is `Object.diffDeletedSymbol` will be removed from the target object
- The original object will be modified, if you want to keep the original object, you can use `Object.dup(target, true)` to clone the object before patching.
- The operation is designed so that `patch(other, diff(current, other))` will transform `other` to match `current`, so after patching, Object.equals(patch(other, diff(current, other)), current) will normally be true.
