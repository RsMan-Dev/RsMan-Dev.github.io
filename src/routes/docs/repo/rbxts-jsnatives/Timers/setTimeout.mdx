Uses runService.Heartbeat to call the function in given Timeout

```ts
const a = setTimeout(() => {
  print("Hello, world!"); // will be called in 1 second
}, 1000);
```

<br/>

Returns a handle to the timeout, which can be used to clear the timeout
The handle is a table, to ensure that we gets a unique reference

```ts
const a = setTimeout(() => {
  print("Hello, world!"); // will be called in 1 second
}, 1000);

clearTimeout(a); // will not be called
```
