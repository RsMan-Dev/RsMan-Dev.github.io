# getOwner and runWithOwner

Functions for managing computation ownership in reactive contexts.

## Signature

```ts
function getOwner(): ComputationNode | undefined;
function runWithOwner<T>(owner: ComputationNode | undefined, fn: () => T): T;
```

## Description

The ownership system in rbxts-signals manages the lifecycle of reactive computations. Every computation (created with functions like `createEffect` or `createMemo`) is an owner, and when the owner is disposed, all of its owned computations are disposed as well.

`getOwner()` returns the current running computation that owns the current context, or `undefined` if there is none.

`runWithOwner()` runs a function with a specified owner, and then restores the previous owner after the function is executed. This is particularly useful in asynchronous contexts where the owner would otherwise be undefined.

## Examples

### Basic owner retrieval

```ts
// Inside a computation, the current computation is the owner
createEffect(() => {
  const owner = getOwner();
  print(`Effect has an owner: ${owner !== undefined}`); // Prints: "Effect has an owner: true"
});

// Outside a computation, there is no owner
const outsideOwner = getOwner();
print(`Outside has an owner: ${outsideOwner !== undefined}`); // Prints: "Outside has an owner: false"
```

### Running code with an owner

```ts
createRoot((dispose) => {
  const rootOwner = getOwner(); // Get the root computation node
  
  // Later, in an asynchronous context where the owner would be lost
  task.spawn(() => {
    const asyncOwner = getOwner();
    print(`Async has an owner: ${asyncOwner !== undefined}`); // Prints: "Async has an owner: false"
    
    // Use runWithOwner to restore the owner
    runWithOwner(rootOwner, () => {
      const restoredOwner = getOwner();
      print(`Restored owner: ${restoredOwner !== undefined}`); // Prints: "Restored owner: true"
      
      // Create a new computation that will be owned by the root owner
      createEffect(() => {
        print("This effect is owned by the root");
      });
    });
  });
  
  return dispose;
});
```

### Handling events with proper ownership

```ts
createRoot((dispose) => {
  const count = createSignal(0);
  const owner = getOwner(); // Store the current owner
  
  // Set up a button click handler
  const button = new Instance("TextButton");
  button.Text = "Increment";
  button.Parent = game.Workspace;
  
  // The event callback will run outside of any reactive context
  button.Activated.Connect(() => {
    // Use runWithOwner to run with the correct ownership context
    runWithOwner(owner, () => {
      count(count() + 1);
      print(`Count: ${count()}`);
      
      // Create an effect that will be properly owned
      createEffect(() => {
        print(`Effect from button click: ${count()}`);
      });
    });
  });
  
  onCleanup(() => {
    button.Destroy();
  });
  
  return dispose;
});
```

### Creating disposable computations in async contexts

```ts
const createAsyncComputation = (callback: () => void): () => void => {
  // Get the current owner before going async
  const owner = getOwner();
  
  // Return a function that creates a disposable computation
  return () => {
    return createRoot((dispose) => {
      runWithOwner(owner, () => {
        callback();
      });
      return dispose;
    });
  };
};

// Usage
createEffect(() => {
  const message = createSignal("Hello");
  
  // Create a disposable async computation
  const createDisposable = createAsyncComputation(() => {
    createEffect(() => {
      print(`Async effect: ${message()}`);
    });
  });
  
  // Later, create and dispose the computation
  const dispose = createDisposable();
  
  // Later, dispose it
  task.delay(5, () => {
    dispose();
  });
});
```
