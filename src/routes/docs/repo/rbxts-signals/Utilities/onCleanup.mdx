# onCleanup

Registers a cleanup function that runs when the owner is disposed.

## Signature

```ts
function onCleanup(fn: (final: boolean) => void): void;
```

## Description

The `onCleanup()` function registers a callback to be executed when the current owner (computation) is disposed. This is useful for cleanup tasks like disconnecting events, clearing intervals, or freeing resources.

The cleanup function is automatically called when:
- The owner computation is re-run (with `final = false`)
- The owner computation is disposed (with `final = true`)

The `final` parameter indicates whether the cleanup is happening due to the final disposal of the owner or just because the computation is re-running.

## Examples

### Basic usage

```ts
createEffect(() => {
  print("Effect running");
  
  onCleanup((final) => {
    if (final) {
      print("Effect is being disposed completely");
    } else {
      print("Effect is being re-run");
    }
  });
});

// Prints: "Effect running"
// When a dependency changes: Prints "Effect is being re-run" followed by "Effect running"
// When explicitly disposed: Prints "Effect is being disposed completely"
```

### Cleaning up resources

```ts
const visible = createSignal(true);

createEffect(() => {
  if (visible()) {
    const connection = game.Workspace.ChildAdded.Connect((child) => {
      print(`Child added: ${child.Name}`);
    });
    
    onCleanup(() => {
      connection.Disconnect();
      print("Connection disconnected");
    });
  }
});

// Later, when visibility changes:
visible(false); // Prints: "Connection disconnected"
```

### Using with createRoot

```ts
const dispose = createRoot((dispose) => {
  const timer = createSignal(0);
  
  // Set up an interval
  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    timer(timer() + 1);
  }, 1000);
  
  // Clean up when root is disposed
  onCleanup(() => {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
    print("Timer stopped");
  });
  
  createEffect(() => {
    print(`Timer: ${timer()}`);
  });
  
  return dispose;
});

// Later, to clean up everything:
dispose(); // Prints: "Timer stopped"
```

### Multiple cleanup handlers

```ts
createEffect(() => {
  const resourceA = acquireResourceA();
  const resourceB = acquireResourceB();
  
  // Register multiple cleanup handlers
  onCleanup(() => {
    resourceA.release();
    print("Resource A released");
  });
  
  onCleanup(() => {
    resourceB.release();
    print("Resource B released");
  });
  
  print("Using resources A and B");
});

// When the effect is disposed:
// Prints: "Resource B released"
// Prints: "Resource A released"
// (Cleanup functions are called in reverse order of registration)
```
