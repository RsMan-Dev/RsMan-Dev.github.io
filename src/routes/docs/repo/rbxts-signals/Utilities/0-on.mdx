# on

Controls dependency tracking with fine-grained precision.

## Signature

```ts
function on<I, T>(
  on: () => I, 
  fn: (r: I, v?: T) => T, 
  options?: { defer?: boolean }
): (old?: T) => T;
```

## Description

The `on()` function provides fine-grained control over dependency tracking. It separates the tracking phase from the execution phase, allowing you to explicitly define which reactive dependencies should trigger updates.

It works by:
1. Running the first function (`on`) in tracking mode to establish dependencies
2. Running the second function (`fn`) in untracked mode, with the result of the first function as its argument

This approach gives precise control over what reactive values cause the computation to re-run, while still being able to access other reactive values without creating dependencies.

## Parameters

- `on`: The tracking function that establishes dependencies
- `fn`: The execution function that receives the result of the tracking function and the previous result
- `options`: 
  - `defer`: When true, skips the initial execution and only runs on the first change (defaults to false)

## Examples

### Basic usage

```ts
const firstName = createSignal("John");
const lastName = createSignal("Doe");
const fullName = createSignal("");

// Only re-run when firstName or lastName changes, not fullName
createEffect(on(
  // Tracking function - establishes dependencies
  () => [firstName(), lastName()],
  // Execution function - runs with tracked values, but doesn't track fullName
  ([first, last]) => {
    fullName(`${first} ${last}`);
    print(`Full name set to: ${first} ${last}`);
    return fullName(); // Return for next execution
  }
));

// Updates the effect because firstName is tracked
firstName("Jane");

// Updates the effect because lastName is tracked
lastName("Smith");

// Does NOT update the effect because fullName is not tracked
fullName("Manual Override");
```

### With defer option

```ts
const count = createSignal(0);


createEffect(on(
  () => count(),
  (value, prev) => {// Skip initial execution and only run on changes
    print(`Count changed from ${prev} to ${value}`);
    return value;
  },
  { defer: true }
));

print("Initial count:", count());

count(1);
// Prints: "Count changed from undefined to 1"

count(2);
// Prints: "Count changed from 1 to 2"
```
