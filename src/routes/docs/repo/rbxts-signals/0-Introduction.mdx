# rbxts-signals

A reactive state management system for Roblox TypeScript (roblox-ts) inspired by S.js, SolidJS, Preact, and Signals.dart.

## Overview

This package provides a powerful reactive system that allows for efficient state management in Roblox TypeScript applications. It offers a signals-based approach to reactivity, where dependencies are automatically tracked and components are only updated when their dependencies change.

> Note: rbxts-signals highly depends on rbxts-jsnatives, libary that provides javascript-like api for roblox.

## Features

- **Fine-grained reactivity** - Only update what changed, not the entire component
- **Automatic dependency tracking** - No need to manually specify dependencies
- **Signal-based state** - Intuitive API for creating and using reactive state
- **Effects and Memos** - Create reactive computations that respond to state changes
- **Batched updates** - Multiple updates are batched together for efficiency
- **Context API** - Provide values to components without prop drilling

## Key Concepts

- **Signals** - Core primitive for reactive state
- **Computations** - Track dependencies and execute code when dependencies change
- **Effects** - Side effects that run when dependencies change
- **Memos** - Cached computations that update only when dependencies change
- **Batch** - Group updates together for performance
- **Context** - Share state across components without prop drilling

## Usage

Import the specific utilities from the library:

```ts
import { createSignal, createEffect, createMemo } from "@rbxts/signals";

// Create a signal with an initial value
const count = createSignal(0);

// Create an effect that runs when dependencies change
createEffect(() => {
  print(`Count is now: ${count()}`);
});

// Create a memo that computes a value based on dependencies
const doubleCount = createMemo(() => count() * 2);

// Update the signal value
count(1); // Effect will run, printing "Count is now: 1"
print(doubleCount()); // Outputs: 2
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install @rbxts/signals
```

You can also install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
npm install @rbxts/signals@github:RsMan-Dev/rbxts-signals
