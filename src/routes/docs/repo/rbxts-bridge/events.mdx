# Events

The event system in rbxts-bridge allows for type-safe communication between server and client through remote events.

## Declaring Event Types

To ensure type safety for your events, declare your event types in the global `BridgeEventMap` interface:

```ts
declare global {
  interface BridgeEventMap {
    playerJoined: { playerId: number; username: string };
    gameStateChanged: { state: string; countdown: number };
    collectItem: { itemId: string; position: Vector3 };
  }
}
```

## Listening for Events

Use `bridge.on` to register an event handler:

```ts
// Server-side
bridge.on("collectItem", (data, player) => {
  // data is typed as { itemId: string; position: Vector3 }
  print(`${player.Name} collected item ${data.itemId} at ${data.position}`);
  // Perform server-side logic
});

// Client-side
bridge.on("gameStateChanged", (data, player) => {
  // data is typed as { state: string; countdown: number }
  print(`Game state changed to ${data.state} with countdown ${data.countdown}`);
  // Update the UI or game state
});
```

## Sending Events

Use `bridge.send` to send an event:

```ts
// Client-side sending to server
bridge.send("collectItem", { 
  itemId: "coin-123", 
  position: new Vector3(10, 5, 10) 
});

// Server-side sending to a specific client
bridge.send("gameStateChanged", { 
  state: "starting", 
  countdown: 10 
}, player);
```

## Broadcasting to All Clients

Use `bridge.broadcast` to send an event to all connected clients:

```ts
// Server-side only
bridge.broadcast("gameStateChanged", { 
  state: "running", 
  countdown: 60 
});
```

## Unregistering Event Handlers

Use `bridge.off` to unregister an event handler:

```ts
// Define the handler function first so you can reference it later
const handleGameStateChanged = (data: BridgeEventMap["gameStateChanged"]) => {
  print(`Game state changed to ${data.state}`);
};

// Register the handler
bridge.on("gameStateChanged", handleGameStateChanged);

// Later, unregister the handler
bridge.off("gameStateChanged", handleGameStateChanged);
```

## Usage with Unknown Types

You can also use events without defining types in the BridgeEventMap, though you'll lose type safety:

```ts
// Handler receives unknown type
bridge.on("undefinedEvent", (data, player) => {
  // data is typed as 'unknown'
  print("Received data:", data);
});

// Sending untyped data
bridge.send("undefinedEvent", { 
  anyData: "can be sent" 
});
```

## Error Handling

It's a good practice to check if the event exists on the other side:

```ts
// Server-side
try {
  bridge.send("clientEvent", data, player, false);
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the case where the client doesn't have the event
  warn(`Client ${player.Name} doesn't have 'clientEvent' registered`);
}
```

The fourth parameter (`ignoreUnset`) determines whether to suppress warnings when the event isn't registered on the recipient.
